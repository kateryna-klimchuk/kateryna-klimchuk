## Hi there 👋

- 💻 I'm motivated and results-driven software developer with a robust background in front-end technologies and a comprehensive transition to full-stack development. Experienced in building responsive, user-friendly web applications and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.
- 🎓 I’m constantly learning new skills and improving my knowledge, especially around **frontend** technologies.
- 🛠️ My favorite tech stack is **TypeScript**, **React**, **Remix**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on expanding my knowledge of **GraphQL** and implementing my knowledge to own pet projects.
- ✨ When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech, working on pet projects, or enjoying time with my hobbies.
- 🎯 I aim to contribute to open-source and grow the developer community.
