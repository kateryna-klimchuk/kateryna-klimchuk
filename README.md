## Hi there 👋

- 💻 I'm a web developer with a focus on full-stack development.
- 🎓 I’m constantly learning new skills and improving my knowledge, especially around **frontend** technologies.
- 🛠️ My favorite tech stack is **TypeScript**, **React**, **Remix**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on expanding my knowledge of **GraphQL** and **Node.js**.
- ✨ When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech, working on pet projects, or enjoying time with my hobbies.
- 🎯 I aim to contribute to open-source and grow the developer community.
